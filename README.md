# My Linux Memos
*A small compilation of the notes I took while learning to create and manage servers on Linux.*

I first started this for myself so I could remember what I did, what went wrong etc...
I am relatively new to Linux environment so it was a big challenge for me to create and manage a server from scratch!

Most of this comes from what I read on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) tutorials.
They are really well written and often up to date, with really useful comments from the community.

But sometimes you don't get the same result as in the tutos so I had to some research on the side.
I also decided to add some things I thought might be useful for later when I forget how I did this or that.

Anyway, it's not the best guide out there, but it helps me to manage my servers and build new ones so definitely hope it can help others!<br>
Also a huge thank you to *DigitalOcean* for their tutorials and help!
